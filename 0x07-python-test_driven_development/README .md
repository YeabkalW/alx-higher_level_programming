The importance of testing in software development cannot be overstated. Testing involves executing a system in order to identify gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements. It is essential to ensure that the code is free from errors and meets all the requirements before deploying it in the production environment. Code that is not tested cannot be trusted.
