In this project, we have begun working with loop and conditional statements in Python, specifically focusing on the use of if-else conditionals, for loops, and while loops. These constructs are commonly used in programming to implement control flow in a program and enable the program to perform different actions based on certain conditions.


## Tasks

task covered in this project are as follows

    0-positive_or_negative.py
        [displays the polarity of random number generated]

    1-last_digit.py
        [prints the last digit stored in a variable]

    2-print_alphabet.py
        [prints the ASCII alphabet.]

    3-print_alphabt.py
        [prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase.]

    4-print_hexa.py
        [prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal]
    
    5-print_comb2.py
        [prints numbers from 0 to 99]

    6-print_comb3.py
        [prints all possible different combinations of two digits.]

    7-islower.py
        [function that checks for lowecase character]
    
    8-uppercase.py
        [function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.]

    9-print_last_digit.py
        [function that prints the last digit of a number.]
    
    10-add.py
        [function that adds two integers and returns the result.]

    11-pow.py
        [function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.]
