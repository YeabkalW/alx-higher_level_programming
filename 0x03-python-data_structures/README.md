# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

in this project we are working with list and tuples how to access information stored in them furthermore creating them looping over them plus differentiating the right scenario to use either data structure.


## Tasks

the tasks covered in this project are as follows.

    0. print list of integer
        [function that prints all integers of a list.]
    
    1. Secure access to an element in a list
        [function that retrieves an element from a list]

    2. Replace element
        [function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position]
    
    3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
        [function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.]
    
    4. Replace in a copy
        [function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list]

    5. Can you C me now?
        [function that removes all characters c and C from a string.]
    
    6. Lists of lists = Matrix
        [function that prints a matrix of integers.]
    
    7. Tuples addition
        [function that adds 2 tuples.]

    8. More returns!
        [function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.]

    9. Find the max
        [function that finds the biggest integer of a list.]
    
    10. Only by 2
        [function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.]

    11. Delete at
        [function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.]
    
    12. Switch
        [Completes the source code in order to switch value of a and b]
